So far I am doing well, while continuing my effort to learn 6 programming languages in-depth over a period of 12 months.

I have covered a 118 pages book written by <a title="A Byte of Python" href="http://www.swaroopch.com" target="_blank">Swaroop </a>CH, and have moved on to "<a title="Dive into Python" href="http://www.diveintopython.net" target="_blank">Dive into Python</a>" by Mark Pilgrim.

Although, Python is a new programming language for me and considering the fact that I have no working knowledge , I am doing pretty well.

I started with Perl, but got stuck at Chapter 5 of 'Beginning Perl', and since then hopped on to Python and is living happily for the last 10 days or so.

I hope to complete "D I Python"Â  in ensuing months, and also solve few problems in codechef.com or Topcoder.com using python.

At least, this effort is paying off in the form of improving my interest in programming.
