Its been almost 2 weeks since I updated about my progress in learning Java and Algorithms. These 10 days have taught me really interesting stuff like; the difference between Brute Force and Greedy Algorithms, Complexity analysis of divide-and-conquer algorithms, an introduction to radix sort.

Although, all of these were interesting, the best part was learning few mathematical nuances, reading Steve Yegge's <a title="Steve Yegge's blog" href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blog</a> about the need of learning mathematics. I agree with him, that it is necessary to learn mathematics and its much more easier when you first do some programming and then try to learn maths, it does help.In Steve's blog he also rants about the interviewing and interviewers, I enjoyed reading that as well.

Other than the above stuff, my primary aim was to actually try solving few programming problems, I did solve few Topcoder - Div-II Level 1 problems, it's helping me to improve my confidence level in solving programming problems.

Above all, what I learned in these 10 days was learning how to count is very important to actually write some good programs.Anyone who is scared of learning probability, permutations and combinations should stay away from programming.
