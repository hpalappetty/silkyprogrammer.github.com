title: A day to remember
---

<p>Yesterday, was an interesting day to remember in many ways.I met with some interesting Entrepreneurs , who are brilliant in their own rights! I would like to call these bunch as "Gang of Four" for now.
We discussed about a lot of things, but the primary discussion revolved around 3 questions.
</p>

<blockquote> 
    <ul>
        <li> Who are you? </li>
        <li> What's your passion? </li>
        <li> Where do you want to see yourself in 3 years? </li>
    </ul>
    
</blockquote>

<p> All the above questions are special, the reason being these are relevant questions that a person asks himself on a daily basis. So, the point
is what are my answers to these questions.</p>

<strong> Who are you? </strong>
<p> How do I answer this question? In a philosophical tone my answer would be , "I am still seraching the truth of my existence.". But, such 
answers have no value in front of today's society which runs purely on materialistic terms.Now, the non materialistic
answer would be I am an IT person ( can't claim to be a professional, as my trial to stick on to one thing has never worked so far! Again
its because Mgrs prefer jack of all trades and master of none kinda people.).</p>
