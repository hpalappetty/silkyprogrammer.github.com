title: A day to remember
---

<p>Yesterday, was an interesting day to remember in many ways.I met with some interesting Entrepreneurs , who are brilliant in their own rights! I would like to call these bunch as "Gang of Four" for now.
We discussed about a lot of things, but the primary discussion revolved around 3 questions.
</p>

<blockquote> 
    <ul>
        <li> Who are you? </li>
        <li> What's your passion? </li>
        <li> Where do you want to see yourself in 3 years? </li>
    </ul>
