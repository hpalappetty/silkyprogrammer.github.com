Title: 'An analysis and suggestions on improving growth and thought leadership at ORGX'
---
<p>
What it would take for ORGX to build thought leadership in technology/software development and become a recognized brand in the industry.</p>

<p>
Thank you for giving me an opportunity to share my analysis on ORGX's growth. I believe for us at ORGX, we need to look into four structures that build our organisation. They are</p>
	
		1. People
		2. Technology
		3. Infrastructure
		4. Products


<p>People are the building blocks of any top institution, at present I see a void ( Big one for sure) at ORGX. We did not consider developing appropriate foundation over the last 4-5 years, this lack of foresight is creating strain on the current team. Now, the question would be what do you mean by Foundation? When I say foundation, I mean talented/trained software professionals who are fresh out of college. Hiring, these good boys/girls is not enough we need to </p>

		1. Create a environment where they are nurtured, rather than beaten to pulp.
		2. We need to have mentors rather than hammers.
		3. We need to motivate and keep motivating youngsters to keep their dreams flowing.
		4. We need to help them take decisions, and take up higher responsibilities.
		5. We must not forget our employees who are deployed in Client Sites, they earn for our survival.
		6. HR team must be able to play a significant role, instead of being pushed into one corner.
		7. HR team must be able to take all human resources/psychology related decisions.
		8. We must get rid of rigid management style and create a free flowing expressive style for growth.
		9. Our managers must become change agents, not obstacles in progress.

<P>Once, we have people then we need their skills for the growth of ORGX. Over the period of ORGX's existence the company has forgotten what it was built for and has fallen into the comfortable cog of supplying skilled professionals to meet needs of Clients. This must change, we must introspect and see what we want to build as an organisation. It is good to continue consulting as a source of revenue, but it must be quality based consulting rather than margin based quantity consulting. Currently, we are following the path of another Infy,Wipro,Satyam or any other Indian MNC's which provide such services, there is no differentiating factor for ORGX at present.	

Technology  - Again, over the last few years when startup's embraced technologies like Python, Ruby, Django, Rails, NodeJS to take world by storm, we sat with our comfort zone of PHP & Java. Today, when we look back I feel, we lost several opportunities to take the lead in market because of this. But, then as the saying goes " better late than never",</P>

		1. We must have proper technology adoption/rejection strategy.
		2. We must develop champions in our focus areas - easy to train a young dragon.
		3. We must look out into the world and capture the trends to take the lead.
		4. We must encourage writing blogs and articles to share wealth of knowledge.
		5. We must create a learning culture, where our employees can learn, experiment and develop.
		6. Internet & Mobility is the future, we must embrace it, love it, live it and sleep on it.
		7. Technology leadership must embrace the new world order- Internet of everything.

<p>Infrastructure - Although, we have a great office the backbone on which an IT company's life revolves around ( Internet) is very bad in our case. My experience is that it is unstable and have a very fluctuating behvaior which makes production deployments very difficult on a bad day.</p>

		1. We must have very solid internet connection - and it must work when it is needed the most.
		2. We must give good laptop's to our engineers - A good Laptop is a basic necessity.

<p>Finally, we have people, skills and infrastructure in place - what we need is our own products either used internally, sold externally or opensourced. I understand, we cannot have multiple products - but we can have atleast 2 or 3 good products in the space of e-learning, PLM (product lifecycle management) or mobility which all of our employees can contribute to.</p>
		1. We must inculcate/facilitate habit in our employees to contribute to opensource.

<p>I know, few years down the lane, I will have to step aside so that another youngster can lead. That is how nature balances it, change is the only constant - we all have to move on. But, I feel we all can move on after making an impact in few people's life because only that will remain for long.I do not know, how much of what I wrote is in sync with becoming a thoughleader or a brand to reckon with in this ever changing industry. But I honestly think, if we play it right we can stay for long and actually become a force to reckon with in another 5 to 10 years time. </p>
