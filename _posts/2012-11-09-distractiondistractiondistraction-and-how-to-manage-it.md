<strong>The Problem :</strong> Getting distracted quite frequently ( in between work)- Yakkk, very bad
</p>
<p>While coding, what do I need to get good work out of me ?</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>A computer ( I plug my Macbook to a 27 inch Monitor so that I can see everything clearly )</li>
	<li>An Editor ( The battle ground, where I should be sword fighting)</li>
	<li>A Browser ( As my support - and at times as villain - I tend to use Chrome/Firefox in tandem I need to fix this habit and start using just one.)</li>
	<li>Terminal/Command Prompt ( iTerm2 - I got this one recently and I love the way it displays split windows)</li>
	<li>Music ( Although I hate iTunes, I don't have any other options such as Spotify or Pandora, may be someday they'll launch it here with Bollywood beats - I am a big fan of Bhangra music Yo Yo Honey Singh ;) )</li>
	<li> Internet (24x7) but this connectivity can be a nightmare at times</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These items above should be good enough to get some code out from me(If it's a late night session, then there is nothing better). The problem is, mind wanders like a rein-less horse at times.And , it just gets into the jungle called internet and starts searching for new Mac hacks, apps, this code that code .... I should say sometimes, It just sucks you in and takes all your precious time.</p>

<p>The way technology is proliferating every aspect of our life, this is bound to happen. And, being a coder(although, this is not my real job) interested in learning the inner workings of all these magical softwares that I see around me, I am gonna dig the dirt isn't it.</p>

<strong>What happened last two days?</strong>

<p>Lets get to the matter. I am no big coder of Objective-C (or any other programming language for that matter), Apple even after being one of the most valuable company in this world, asks poor developers to shell out $100 to be part of their developer network and push apps to Mac App Store, So I never tried to learn Objective-C. Let me not beat around the bush, and say I just did not spent enough time trying to learn it. But, on Thursday(8th,Nov) I happened to download "Adium" sourcecode from their website. Man, this sucked me in ! for 2 days instead of doing my original work, I was behind this code  trying to understand the inner workings of this native OSX app. I found, the code neatly written, also impressed by the fact that the lead developer is a doctor ( kudos to him), and on a daily basis I am getting to learn that a better programmer generally do not necessarily have a CS background.It's the passion for the kind of work that they are doing, drives most of the good programmers I guess!</p>

<p>I am sure, now you are getting a hang of how my mind wanders from one topic to another, and goes into deeper echleons! Not a good habit!</p>

<strong>The solution:</strong>

<p>There are plenty of solutions suggested by knowledgeable people, some of my favorite ones that I use to try and get myself back are</p>
<blockquote>
 	<ul>
		<li>Pomodoro technique ( If you use kanbanflow.com  they have a nice looking pomodoro timer try it out its free)</li>
		<li>The 50+10 rule ( Avoid all distractions and work for 50 minutes then take 10 mins break)</li>
		<li>The 15 + 5 rule ( 15mins work+ 5 mins break, increment it slowly till you can get to the 50+10 rule)</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>Will it work:</strong>

<p>That's totally up to you :)</p>
