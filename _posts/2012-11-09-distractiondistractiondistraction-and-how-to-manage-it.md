Okay ! Now What did I notice over the last 2 days. It is not that I did not notice it before, but the situation was very prominent over the last 2 days and I had to take some action to get out of the issue.

<strong>The Problem :</strong> Getting distracted quite frequently ( in between work)- Yakkk, very bad

Being a programmer, what do I need to get good work out of me ?
<ol>
	<li>My computer ( I plug my Mac to a 27 inch Monitor so that I can see everything clearly )</li>
	<li>IDE ( The battle ground, where I should be sword fighting)</li>
	<li>Browser ( As my support - and at times as villain - I tend to use Chrome/Firefox in tandem I need to fix this habit and start using just one.)</li>
	<li>Terminal ( iTerm2 - I got this one recently and I love the way it displays split windows)</li>
	<li>Ohh and Yes Music ( Although I hate iTunes, I don't have any other options such as Spotify or Pandora, may be someday they'll launch it here with Bollywood beats - I am a big fan of Bhangra music Yo Yo Honey Singh ;) )</li>
	<li>Ohhh forgot - Internet (24x7) but this connectivity can be a nightmare at times</li>
</ol>
As long as these are the only set up , I am saved. But the problem is mind wanders like a rein-less horse at times. And , it just get into the jungle called internet and start searching for new Mac hacks, apps, this code that code .... I should say sometimes It just sucks you in and takes all your precious time.

I am very sure about the fact that I can't blame myself nor anyone. The way technology is proliferating every aspect of our life, this is bound to happen. And, being a software engineer interested in the inner workings of all these magical softwares that I see around me I am gonna dig the dirt isn't it.

<strong>What happened last two days?</strong>

Okay, getting into the matter. I am no big coder of Objective-C, the reason being Apple even after being the most valuable company in the world asks developers to shell out $100 to be part of their developer network and push the apps to Mac App Store. And, there is plenty of developers already there developing n number of apps so didn't bother much beyond learning the basics. But, on Thursday I happened to go through "Adium" website and download the sourcecode for the chat app. Man, this sucked me in ! for the last 2 days instead of doing my original work, I was behind this code  to understand the inner workings of this native OSX app. I found the code neatly written, also impressed by the fact that the lead developer is a doctor ( kudos to him), and on a daily basis I am getting to learn that a better programmer generally  is not a CS graduate. Most of the above average or great programmers that I have seen have a non CS background, I wonder why is that? Someone else can give me an answer to that!

I am sure, now you are getting a hang of how my mind wanders from one topic to another, and goes away deeper and deeper.

<strong>The solution:</strong>

There are plenty of solutions suggested by many people, some of my favorite ones that I use to get myself back are
<ol>
	<li>Pomodoro technique ( If you use kanbanflow.com  they have a nice looking pomodoro timer try it out its free)</li>
	<li>The 50+10 rule ( Avoid all distractions and work for 50 minutes then take 10 mins break)</li>
	<li>The 15 + 5 rule ( 15mins work+ 5 mins break, increment it slowly till you can get to the 50+10 rule)</li>
</ol>
<strong>Will it work:</strong>

That's totally up to you :)
