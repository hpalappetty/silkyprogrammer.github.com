title: '100 days went away'

---
<p>
It has been an interesting 100 days, since I decided to improve my programming skills. What, I learned after these many days is that I have a lot to learn and have to continuously immerse myself to learn something and show case my skills over the days to come.This month, I have decided to focus on starting C++ programming.</p>

<p>Current schedule goes like this,</p>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>C++ ( daily dose).</li>
		<li>Harvard CS50 (to improve my fundamental programming/cs skills).</li>
		<li>Solve 5 maths problems/day.</li>
		<li>Other interesting stuff.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>

<p> That is the end of update. </p>
