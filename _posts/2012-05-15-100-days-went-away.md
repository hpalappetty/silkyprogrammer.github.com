title: '100 days went away'

---

It has been an interesting 100 days, since I decided to improve my programming skills. What, I learned after these many days is that I have a lot to learn and have to continuously immerse myself to learn something and show case my skills over the days to come.

This month, I have decided to focus on starting C++ programming.

Current schedule goes like this,
<ol>
	<li>C++ ( daily dose).</li>
	<li>Harvard CS50 ( to improve my fundamental programming/cs skills).</li>
	<li>Solve 5 maths problems/day.</li>
	<li>Other interesting stuff.</li>
</ol>
