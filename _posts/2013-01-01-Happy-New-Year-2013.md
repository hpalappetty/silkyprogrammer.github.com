title: 'Happy New Year 2013 & a rewind to 2012'
---

The year 2012 was a good one in terms of setting up a goal, and working
towards the goal. Although, I would say I did not make any significant
progression in the desired direction, I learned a lot from this
exercise.I went through several programming languages, bought license for few
good IDE's to test them out and tested them out as well.

So, this one year helped me to move from a novice to a bit more advanced
level person in the field of Software Engineering. I managed to build &
deploy a website on my own, this exercise helped me to learn a lot about
web administration which otherwise I would have never learned.

All in all , it was a good experience and helped me bootstrap to year
-2013.

In 2013, my focus is to take the skills that I acquired in the last 1
year to next level. To achieve this, I plan to start participating in
Live TopCoder SRM's and start solving examples from Euler using Java &
Python.Although, my mind at time lingers around C++, for now I am firmly
focussing on these two.

My IDE Choices:
<p> <blockquote>
    <ul>
        <li> IntelliJ - for Java </li>
        <li> PyCharm - for Python </li>
        <li> MacVim - In general</li>
    </ul> </blockquote>
</p>
That's all from me on this new year day, will write more soon.
