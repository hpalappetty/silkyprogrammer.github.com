title: Understanding stretch goals! My Perspective!

I am a firm believer of stretching your goals a bit extra! This helps you test and understand a lot about yourself, your ability to achieve certain goals within its allocated time, what needs to be done in case of gaps and many more useful insights!

Recently, I experimited myself by walking from "Marthahalli Bridge bus station" to "Iris Inn, Mahadevapura" as a short stretch goal. Scenario was riddled with infrequent rains, bad traffic, no lights(it was around 6:45PM), dirt everywhere, rude drivers and no footpath!

What is the goal, I wanted to achieve?

How did I plan to execute it?

Why did I do it?
