title: 'Whirlwind of Thoughts and a decision at the End'

---
<p>
Last week was tumultuous. Python,C++,Java,Puzzles,PHP. What not! my brain just exploded and got into a very confusing state.Finally, it was time to streamline my efforts, otherwise I may not reach anywhere.
Although, Java/Python are great programming languages , there are certain problems that can be solved better with C ( esp. when timing/execution speed is concerned, while writing algorithms or programs that needs faster execution speeds).Now the question is, where should I spent most of my time at ( learning Java/Python Vs C/C++). I consider PHP as a hobby language, hence I do not want to allocate time on a regular basis to learn it. weekends/free time will work just fine.
</p>

<p>I decided to do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Concentrate on Java ( as it helps me to solve most of the problems)</li>
	<li style="text-align:left;">Learn deep concepts in this Programming language, and learn Java.lang.Math and other Math related libraries very well ( This is to help me solve various algo.problems).</li>
	<li>Start with Thinking in Java 4th ed by Bruce Eckel ( this is like unlearning everything I learned previously and starting afresh).</li>
	<li>Supplement with Data Structures and Algorithms in Java by Prof.Bruno ( Waterloo)</li>
</ol>

<p>Allocate an hour or so from free time to learn C/C++ - Start from Thinking in C, by Bruce Eckel ( Chapter by Chapter and advance to C++, 'Brick by Brick, just like the Seabiscuit who came back from nowhere and won the hearts of million americans).</p>
