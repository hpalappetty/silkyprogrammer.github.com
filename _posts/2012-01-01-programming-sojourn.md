It's been a tumultuous week with the year ending and the beginning on new year 2012, as well as the speed with which various thoughts that crossed my mind about strategizing my approach towards learning 6 programming languages in 12 months.

I have managed to complete 62 pages out of 118 from 'A byte of Python' and is on my way to complete a python programming text book. Hopefully, it will be done soon so I can explore more about the language and try solving problems using it.

I am going to read more about using 'Data structures' in Python and continue working towards perfecting the language from there.
So far the reading is going well, and python is an interesting programming language and safe to say, it is easier to learn than 'Java' or 'C++'.
