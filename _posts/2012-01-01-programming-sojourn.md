It's been a tumultuous week with the year ending and the beginning of
new year(2012), as well as the speed with which various thoughts that
crossed my mind about strategizing my approach towards learning 6
programming languages in 12 months.It was a bit too much I guess!

I have managed to complete 62 pages out of 118 from 'A byte of Python'
and is on my way to complete a python programming text book(basic).
Hopefully I will complete it soon, so that I can start exploring more and start solving problems using it.

I will be reading more about 'Data structures' in Python and continue
working towards mastering the language from there.
So far the reading is going well, and python is an interesting
programming language.And safe to say, it is easier to learn than 'Java' or 'C++'.
