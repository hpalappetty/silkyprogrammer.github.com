After several trials to install C++ dev environment on my laptop, I
finally managed to do it. Good perseverance :).

Thanks to www.cprogramming.com , for introducing me to Code::Blocks and thanks to all those developers who developed and enhanced Fedora.

Installation of code blocks was pretty easy, just type in the following command

    $sudo yum install codeblocks

 ( you should have admin rights to
install it, hence sudo - superuser this will install all dependencies
too).

In order to run code::blocks, just type in codeblocks to your terminal
prompt.It will look like: 

    [[username]@[computername] ~]$ codeblocks
