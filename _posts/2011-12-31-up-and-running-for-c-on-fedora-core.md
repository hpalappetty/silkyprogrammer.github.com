After several trials to install C++ dev environment on my laptop, I finally managed to do it. Good perseverance :) I am not that known for it.

Thanks to www.cprogramming.com , for introducing me to Code::Blocks and thanks to all those developers who developed and enhanced Fedora.

Installation of code blocks was pretty easy, just type in the following command

<em>sudo yum install codeblocks</em> ( you need admin rights to install it, hence sudo - superuser do the following on my system :)) this will install all dependencies too.

to run code::blocks, just type in codeblocks to your terminal prompt ( so it will look like the following : <em>[[username]@[computername] ~]$</em> codeblocks
