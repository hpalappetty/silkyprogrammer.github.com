I was gloriously trying to ignore learning C/C++ . The reason being I hate these two programming languages , may my hate is due to the fact that I never had good classes for these two languages when I was in college.

My teachers generally memorized the programming books by 'Balaguruswamy' and delivered it to the class. I never enjoyed their classes and ended up memorizing thousands of lines of code without understanding the meaning of any of it.

So, by god's grace ( if he is an existential being - Â added these words in brackets as I am reminded myself about the school of thought followed by Newton,Socrates,Keppler) I managed to pass my 1st sem C-programming exam(theory) and Lab. The same problem continued in almost all of my programming classes 8085 processor lab,Pic Micro-controller lab,Telcom switching lab everywhere there was programming I actually got flopped gloriously.

But, then reached CDAC-Pune, the school helped me to atleast get rid of my anger towards programming ( Java was the saviour). But now, after a whirpool of trip around the world and education I am getting back to basics myself, no one to help other than 'Google' and the reverend internet authors who has put up their stuff on internet. I am starting again with 'Introduction to Algorithms' called as the 'CLRS' book by the real programmers. Although, I can implement these in Python or any new programming language, I am humbled by the need to learn C/C++ to improve my computing concepts.

So for those of you not giving attention to any of your courses and wasting time during college days, beware someday in your life you will learn it the hard way as I did.

So strap on and work hard and party hard later !!!
