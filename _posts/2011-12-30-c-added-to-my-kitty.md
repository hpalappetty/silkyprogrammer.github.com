I was gloriously trying to ignore learning C/C++. The reason is, I hate
these two programming languages, may be my hate is due to the fact that
I never had good classes/teachers for these two languages when I was in college.

My teachers generally memorized the programming books by 'Balaguruswamy' and delivered it to the class. I never enjoyed their classes and ended up memorizing thousands of lines of code without understanding the meaning of any of it.

By god's grace, I managed to pass my 1st sem C-programming exam(theory) and Lab. The same problem continued in almost all of my programming classes 8085 processor lab,Pic Micro-controller lab,Telcom switching lab everywhere there was programming I actually got flopped gloriously.

But, then I ended up in CDAC-Pune to learn Advanced Computing, this
school helped me to atleast get rid of my anger towards programming (
Java was my saviour). But now, after a whirpool trip around the globe
and education I am getting back to basics myself, no one to help other
than 'Google' and the authors who has put up their content on internet.
I am starting again with 'Introduction to Algorithms' called as the
'CLRS' book by many programmers.I am humbled by the need to learn C/C++ to improve my computing concepts.

So for those of you who are not giving attention to any of your
courses/classes and wasting time during college days, be aware someday in your life you will learn it the hard way as I did.

So strap on and work hard and party hard later !!!
