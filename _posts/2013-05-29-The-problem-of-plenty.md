<p>I have been distracted quite frequently for the last few months.The reason is, number of programming languages that is doing rounds on internet</p>
<ul>
    <li>C</li>
    <li>C++</li>
    <li>C#</li>
    <li>Java</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>RubyC</li>
    <li>Haskell</li>
    <li>OCaml</li>
    <li>Haskell</li>
    <li>F#</li>
    <li>D</li>
</ul>
<p> How on earth are we supposed to learn or keep track of all these languages. I agree that it is not necessary to learn
all of them or know most of them, but isn't it distracting in nature?. When you sit to study Java, someone will write great
notes about C++, then by the time you read few lines about C++ you will read something about, how learning python helped
someone to write better C++....... the list goes on </p>

<p>There is high chance that, over the next decade we will end up with programmers , who are master of none and jack of all. This
may not be a good thing for specialist jobs, where in depth knowledge in particular language is so important to contribute well
towards a project.</p>

<p> That said, there is nothing wrong in knowing half dozen programming languages. Knowing is not same as learning.</p>
