title: 'Dan Shipper, Steve Yegge, Jason Freedman a whole new bunch is cropping up!'

---

I read an interesting article today in businessinsider.com about a UPenn Sophomore 'Dan Shipper' ( danshipper.com). It was pretty interesting to read about
<ol>
	<li>How someone missed this talented boy as a Intern?</li>
	<li>How this person helped him to get another internship at Artsicle?</li>
	<li>An eventual public job offer from Jason Freedman?</li>
	<li>Why Dan is not interested in any offers at present, n why he wants to stay back at Upenn?</li>
	<li>How difficult it is to hire an A Player, who wholeheartedly contribute?</li>
</ol>
My eyes caught this line from Jason's blog <em><strong>" It is very difficult to hire an A player, rather we have to court him/her.</strong></em>" <strong> </strong>This is very true, an A player has dreams of his/her own. His/hers main aim is not to pay 100K on tuition at Princeton/Harvard and then work for FB/Google/a start-up for that matter. They go to college with a purpose - "to learn" not just to get a job. This learning helps them to plan their future  with new lessons and friends as well as fulfill their dreams and ideas.

Also, it should be noted that it is not easy as well for an A player there. They are mostly treated with disdain and disrespect by fellows most of the time by typical  calls such as "nerds", "workaholics", "difficult-to-mange"(this is mostly used by managers who are useless and have no f***ing clue about anything).

Another problem is most of the time, corporate world ends up being a suck-up-to your boss work place. I feel much better after reading these articles about how people are searching for talent, and good ones getting recognized at some point.
