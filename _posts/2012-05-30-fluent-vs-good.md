title: 'Fluent Programmer Vs Good Programmer!'

---

These days I understand the difference between a programmer who is fluent in a particular language versus the one who is good at it. The situation is very similar to a person who is fluent in English/ good in English. When we say fluent, the stuff flows out of the person like water flowing down the stream, beautifully without much hiccups, and even if there are hindrances, it can find its own routes down the hill. He/she wont have to edit it 100 times to correct the syntactical/grammatical details.

This is same in the world of programming. When a programmer reaches the level of fluency he/she can code or rather talk to the computer like talking to humans.The instructions will flow from his/her finger tips through the language of their choice and the chip will interpret it to make the idiot box work.

Now, in case of a good programmer the condition is little different. Yes he/she can code, but they will never be able to talk to the computer :) . To reach that level , you have to be fluent in at least one programming language.

It doesn't really matter which language you learn, but being fluent helps ;) . To be with the world, you can either learn C or C++ or even Java for that matter. Being fluent in any one of the above language is really useful and will help you a lot, if you are aspiring to be a programmer.
