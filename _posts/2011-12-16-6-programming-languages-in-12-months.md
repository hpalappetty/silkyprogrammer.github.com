I am planning to arrangeÂ  in-depth self lessons on 6 programming languages over a period of 12 months(1 year).

Decided to go through the following ones,
	<p><ul>
		<li>Perl ( ignored as of Dec,2012) </li> 
		<li>PHP (ignored as of Dec,2012)</li> 
		<li>Python (Continuing)</li> 
		<li>C++ (Ignored and put my head into Java in 2012, but have plans to takeup in 2013)</li> 
		<li>Objective-C ( Its the newbie in my stack after my wife presented my first MacBook last week) - (ignored as of Dec,2012)</li> 
		<li>JavaScript(Will start in 2013)</li>
	</ul></p>
There will be lot of questions, why no Java,#.Net blah blah blah. I simply don't care , at this point I felt these are the ones I should focus on! I do have a book on Android development written by <a href="http://blog.radioactiveyak.com/" target="_blank"><em>Reto Meier</em></a>, so I may read it intermittently.

Have fun Coding !
