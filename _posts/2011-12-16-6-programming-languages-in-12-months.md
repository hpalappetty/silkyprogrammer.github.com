I am planning to arrangeÂ  in-depth self lessons on 6 programming languages over a period of 12 months.

Decided to go through the following ones,
<ul>
	<li>Perl</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>C++</li>
	<li>Objective-C ( Its the newbie in my stack after my wife presented my first MacBook last week)</li>
	<li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
There might be quite a lot of questions, why no Java,#.Net blah blah blah. I simply don't care , I felt these are the ones I should focus on! I do have a book on Android development written by <a href="http://blog.radioactiveyak.com/" target="_blank"><em>Reto Meier</em></a>, so I may read it intermittently.

Have fun coding!n Hacking !
