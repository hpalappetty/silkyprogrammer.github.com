I"»<p> Over the last few days, I have been mostly getting used to my new
environment in Bangalore.It's been awesome with some really
knowledgeable people around me.I am getting to learn a lot here, and my
mind keeps occupied atleast for now.So, what's the plan for 2013? Here
it is.
</p>

<p> I decided to focus on two topics this year, which is C++ and Python.
Also, another topic which I want to focus on is my concentration levels
and the ability to concentrate for long time. I need to develop this latter
skill a lot more than my programming prowness. I am getting easily
distracted these days with various useless thoughts.</p>

<p> So to achieve the above 3 tasks, I have installed Linux Mint 14 -64
bit on my Office laptop ( obviously with dual boot), so that during
office hours I can work on windows and complete office related work and
when I am free, I can switch on to linux and continue my learning. To
help me write code, I have installed two editors Vim (for Python) and
CodeBlocks(for C++) , I believe this much is enough to accomplish decent
development environment. </p>

<p> I will start working on this from tomorrow and will update the world
about my progress in coming days </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p> You can clearly see me dwindling between Java and C++ quite often,
I finally gave up this psychological dilema and decided to focus on C++.
The reason was an
article(http://www.crosstalkonline.org/storage/issue-archives/2008/200801/200801-Dewar.pdf)
by veteran professors from NYU, I
felt their article was well researched on and a pure outcome of their
quantitative analysis combined with their real world
experience while teaching students and working with professional
programmers.</p>
