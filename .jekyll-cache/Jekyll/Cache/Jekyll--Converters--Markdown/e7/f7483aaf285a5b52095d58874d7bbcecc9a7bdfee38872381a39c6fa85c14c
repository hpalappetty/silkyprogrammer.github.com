I"ô<p>I am planning to arrangeÂ  in-depth self lessons on 6 programming languages over a period of 12 months(1 year).</p>

<p>Decided to go through the following ones,
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Perl ( ignored as of Dec,2012) &lt;/li&gt; 
		&lt;li&gt;PHP (ignored as of Dec,2012)&lt;/li&gt; 
		&lt;li&gt;Python (Continuing)&lt;/li&gt; 
		&lt;li&gt;C++ (Ignored and put my head into Java in 2012, but have plans to takeup in 2013)&lt;/li&gt; 
		&lt;li&gt;Objective-C ( Its the newbie in my stack after my wife presented my first MacBook last week) - (ignored as of Dec,2012)&lt;/li&gt; 
		&lt;li&gt;JavaScript(Will start in 2013)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
There will be lot of questions, why no Java,#.Net blah blah blah. I simply donâ€™t care , at this point I felt these are the ones I should focus on! I do have a book on Android development written by <a href="http://blog.radioactiveyak.com/" target="_blank"><em>Reto Meier</em></a>, so I may read it intermittently.</p>

<p>Have fun Coding !</p>
