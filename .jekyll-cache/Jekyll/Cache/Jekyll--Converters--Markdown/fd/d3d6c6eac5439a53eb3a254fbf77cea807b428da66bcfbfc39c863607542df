I"m<p>Today was an interesting day. I was reading an article about <strong><em>Hilary Mason</em></strong> , the chief data scientist at bitly and I noticed an alternate version of python(IPython - http://ipython.org/) being used by her in her day to day work . Although , I didn’t take it up seriously while reading the article, later when I had some free time I decided to checkout what it is. Being a student of Python I love exploring anything related to python.
All I can say is, I am wowed by the IPython ( such neat documentation and installation guidance), I haven’t seen in so many years of my existence in Software World. I could only see one major setback in the documentation, the screenshots (http://ipython.org/documentation.html - first link) link is broken. Otherwise, everything else is well written, so that any normal person can understand.This is what happens, when researchers with excellent skills put up the documentation, most users of IPython is in academia I guess, from the look of it. But, man it’s awesome. I would like to give an Indian style, “PRANAM” ( show of respect) to the guys who took IPython so far.</p>

<p>May be IPython should be part of the original Python package , so that everyone will benefit out of it. That’s anyway a big decision for the BDFL of Python Mr.Guido.</p>

<p>Anyway, all I can say is IPython, you are so pretty that you took my sleep away and I sitting up so late into the night and trying out my simple python examples on your interpreter at 2:00AM IST.</p>

<p>Current work set up iTerm2 + IPython (For all analytics work)</p>

<p>PyCharm - For all Django development.</p>
