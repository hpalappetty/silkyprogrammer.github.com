I"S<p>It’s been 6 months + , since I decided to actually learn programming. Initial days gave me nightmare’s in terms of selecting a language to learn, about the resources to approach and about how I should spend/manage my time.</p>

<p>190+ days gone by and I really have no regrets. I learned a lot ! actually learned a lot of basics. Unlearned a lot ( There was a load of shit I had to unlearn, basically this was the most difficult part unlearning mistakes learned from previous experience.).</p>
