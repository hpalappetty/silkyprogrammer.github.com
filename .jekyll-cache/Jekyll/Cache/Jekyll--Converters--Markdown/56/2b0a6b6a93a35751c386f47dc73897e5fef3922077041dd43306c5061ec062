I"õ<p>Today I started readingÂ  C++ by Lippman et.al. Just completed browsing through the contents page to get an idea about what is in store for me. There are 18 chapters ( very detailed), and an Appendix A ( some 40 pages). The last page is numbered 843, so I am hoping that its going to be some 430+ pages ( both sides included). The plan is to spent at least 1-2hrs reading and understanding contents from this bookÂ  and practice the examples. Lets see where will I stand after another 90 days!</p>
