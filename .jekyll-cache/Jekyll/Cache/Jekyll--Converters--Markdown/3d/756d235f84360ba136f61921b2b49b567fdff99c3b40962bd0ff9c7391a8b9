I" <p>The obvious choice of place to look for a decent intro to this topic is Ryanâ€™s ( Ryan Bate) railscasts.com website.</p>

<p>The link is [[http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise]]</p>

<p>Looks like this link uses an old version of devise, and trying to get it running on your system might waste a lot of time. Nevertheless, the video stands as a good starting point to learn about the implementation of â€˜deviseâ€™ for your lovely web app.</p>

<p>my suggesstion is while adding gem â€˜deviseâ€™ to your GEMFILE use the following style,</p>

<p>gem â€˜deviseâ€™ , â€˜git://github.com/plataformatec/devise.gitâ€™ ( this is for people who already have some old devise version on their system)</p>

<p>I have noticed that by replacing the version number against the gem will not help you upgrade it to the latest version.</p>

<p>gem â€˜deviseâ€™ â€˜1.1.0rcâ€™ ( or something like this you had)</p>

<p>gem â€˜deviseâ€™ ( this is what you want to do so that latest stuff gets installed) <strong><span style="color:red;">Wonâ€™t Work</span></strong></p>

<p>Remove the old version of devise by running,
$ gem uninstal devise ( on your command prompt)</p>

<p>Then in the gemfile add the following,
gem â€˜deviseâ€™ , â€˜git://github.com/plataformatec/devise.gitâ€™</p>

<p>Then follow, the steps described in README(https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/) file along with Ryanâ€™s screencast you will be good to go.</p>
