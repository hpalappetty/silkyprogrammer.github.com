At home , I keep fiddling with my computerÂ  installing open source code base to read through and learn about the way different people write code. During these sessions, I noticed that, a specific set of commands were used on a daily basis to get my work done on terminal and I felt that it might be usefulÂ  for the people with bad memory ( especially me ;)). A useful excuse to write few lines ;) . Here is the list of frequently used commands by me while working on pet projects.

{<em>PS: This list and the descrption of all the commands will get updated as and when I get more time.Please note this is not a final list, it's an ever growing one ;)}</em>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir [&lt;em&gt;new- directory - name]&lt;/em&gt;

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -ltr

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -la
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>
This commandÂ  helps the user to list all the files/directories including the hidden ones with a "." in the name [e.g. ".profile"]</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ls -l | egrep `^d'

<blockquote>
	$ nano .profileÂ  [<em>I use nano, instead of "vi", please use an editor of your choice]</em>	
</blockquote>

<p>
This is to change .profile file to set the PATH. You can find the .profile file in the home directory. use ctrl +O to save the file and ctrl+x to exit from the file. After you complete this step you have to run/execute this .profile file once to get the set PATH up and working for you. TO DO THAT type inÂ Â  $Â  .Â  ./.profileÂ  and press enter.
</p>
<blockquote>	$ echo $path 	</blockquote>
<p>
This will show you all the set values in system PATH. This is similar to the stuff , we see in Windows PATH variable .
</p>
<blockquote>
	$ sudo ln -s [path-1]/somethingÂ  /usr/local/bin/[something]
	e.g. sudo ln -s /path/to/django/bin/django-admin.py /usr/local/bin/django-admin.py
