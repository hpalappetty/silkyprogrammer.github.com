I"ç<p>After several trials to install C++ dev environment on my laptop, I
finally managed to do it. Good perseverance :).</p>

<p>Thanks to www.cprogramming.com , for introducing me to Code::Blocks and thanks to all those developers who developed and enhanced Fedora.</p>

<p>Installation of code blocks was pretty easy, just type in the following command</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$sudo yum install codeblocks
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>( you should have admin rights to
install it, hence sudo - superuser this will install all dependencies
too).</p>

<p>In order to run code::blocks, just type in codeblocks to your terminal
prompt.It will look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>[[username]@[computername] ~]$ codeblocks
</code></pre></div></div>
