I"Å<p>So far I am doing well, while continuing my effort to learn 6 programming languages in-depth over a period of 12 months.</p>

<p>I have covered a 118 pages book written by <a title="A Byte of Python" href="http://www.swaroopch.com" target="_blank">Swaroop </a>CH, and have moved on to â€œ<a title="Dive into Python" href="http://www.diveintopython.net" target="_blank">Dive into Python</a>â€ by Mark Pilgrim.</p>

<p>Although, Python is a new programming language for me and considering the fact that I have no working knowledge , I am doing pretty well.</p>

<p>I started with Perl, but got stuck at Chapter 5 of â€˜Beginning Perlâ€™, and since then hopped on to Python and is living happily for the last 10 days or so.</p>

<p>I hope to complete â€œD I Pythonâ€Â  in ensuing months, and also solve few problems in codechef.com or Topcoder.com using python.</p>

<p>At least, this effort is paying off in the form of improving my interest in programming.</p>
