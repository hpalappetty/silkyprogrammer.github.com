Hurray! finally after a month long hardwork, I can see some improvement in the way I write Java code. Although, I work as a Business Analyst in my day life, as the night sets in I turn to become a Java coder, pouring my head over algo. problems set in Topcoder/Codechef websites. At present , I am aiming to only solve all the programming puzzles available in the "Easy" section :) Lol! don't feel that they are easy, for a beginner those problems will actually make you feel like "You are a f****ing idiot".</p>

<p>But, anyways with the help of BruceEckel ( TIJ-4th Edition), and CLRS ( Introduction to Algorithms), I should be able to graduate into the upper echleons of programming in a year or two. I hope that is not asking for too much.</p>

<p>Being a self taught programmer is fun, also I feel I wasted to realise my interest in programming a bit early. All those time I spent on Dave and Super Mario, I should have spent it on learning the inner workings of them ! Not bad though, some understanding of electronics is always useful ;) someday I can write code based on the clock cycles of a processor :DDDD</p>
