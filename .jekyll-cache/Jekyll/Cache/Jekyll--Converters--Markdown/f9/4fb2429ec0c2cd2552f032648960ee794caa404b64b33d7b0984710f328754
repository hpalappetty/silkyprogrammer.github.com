I"…<p>
I was in a situation where I had to read 2 arguments from python command line.
 So the situation would look like this in IDLE.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;31 123.00 ( please note there is a space between 31 and 123.00)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The easiest way I felt, I could solve it is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  #!usr/bin/env python
  #withdrawl.py
  list = input().split(' ',1)Â  #comments below
  amt=float(list[0])
  bal=float(list[1])
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>
The input() method reads arguments, split() method splits the
string(argv) and move it to a list as follows ['31','123.00'], which we can read easily as list[0] and list[1].
Once we get the data out, we can process it as we like.</p>
