I read an interesting article today in businessinsider.com about a UPenn Sophomore 'Dan Shipper' ( danshipper.com). It was pretty interesting to read about</p>
<ol>
	<li>How someone missed this talented boy as a Intern?</li>
	<li>How this person helped him to get another internship at Artsicle?</li>
	<li>An eventual public job offer from Jason Freedman?</li>
	<li>Why Dan is not interested in any offers at present, n why he wants to stay back at Upenn?</li>
	<li>How difficult it is to hire an A Player, who wholeheartedly contribute?</li>
</ol>
<p>My eyes caught this line from Jason's blog <em><strong>" It is very difficult to hire an A player, rather we have to court him/her.</strong></em>" <strong> </strong>This is very true, an A player has dreams of his/her own. His/hers main aim is not to pay 100K on tuition at Princeton/Harvard and then work for FB/Google/a start-up for that matter. They go to college with a purpose - "to learn" not just to get a job. This learning helps them to plan their futureÂ  with new lessons and friends as well as fulfill their dreams and ideas.</p>

<p>Also, it should be noted that it is not easy as well for an A player there. They are mostly treated with disdain and disrespect by fellows most of the time by typicalÂ  calls such as "nerds", "workaholics", "difficult-to-mange"(this is mostly used by managers who are useless and have no f***ing clue about anything).</p>

<p>Another problem is most of the time, corporate world ends up being a suck-up-to your boss work place. I feel much better after reading these articles about how people are searching for talent, and good ones getting recognized at some point.
