I"1<p>It is quite wonderful to see loads of pluggable modules being developed and shared by coders around the world. But, whats appalling is the lack of quality or clear directions from many of them on how to use their code. Yeah! Its great that so many of us are writing down awesome obfuscated code which no one can read and understand. Think about it, next time when you publish some code. The internet is an interesting tool which will make our code available to approx.. 7 billion people , so it is imperative that we force ourselves to write clean documentation or else we are gonna get cursed at least a few thousand times!</p>

<p>GITHUB / SOURCEFORGE or whatever other open-source code sharing websites are there not only to publish our code. We can share proper documentation as well along with it.</p>
