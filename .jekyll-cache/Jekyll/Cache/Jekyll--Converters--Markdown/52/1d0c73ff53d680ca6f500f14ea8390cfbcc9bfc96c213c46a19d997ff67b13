I"<p>I am a firm believer of stretching your goals a bit extra! This helps you test and understand a lot about yourself, your ability to achieve certain goals within its allocated time, what needs to be done in case of gaps and many more useful insights!</p>

<p>Recently, I experimited myself by walking from â€œMarthahalli Bridge bus stationâ€ to â€œIris Inn, Mahadevapuraâ€ as a short stretch goal. Scenario was riddled with infrequent rains, bad traffic, no lights(it was around 6:45PM), dirt everywhere, rude drivers and no footpath!</p>

<p>What is the goal, I wanted to achieve?</p>

<p>How did I plan to execute it?</p>

<p>Why did I do it?</p>
