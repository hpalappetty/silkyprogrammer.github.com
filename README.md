This is my github page blog.

I have taken the base from git https://github.com/danielmcgraw/Jekyll-Base.git

Used the following to make this blog:
<ol>
   <li>SublimeText(Editor of Choice)</li>
   <li>Vim (Learning this one)</li>
   <li>Referred to various blogs in github pages to create a good
structure and theme.</li>
</ol>
