<h1>HELLO WORLD!</h1>
<p>
My name is <strong>Hari Palappetty</strong>, I work as a Product Manager at one of the top startup in India. My area of interests are Mobile(Android is fav :)), Algorithms and Mathematics. During free time ( mostly driving or on weekends), I do think about freaky ideas in Social Analytics - understanding patterns using Social network API's such as Facebook, Twitter or Linkedin.
