<h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
<p>
My name is <strong>Hari</strong>, and I live a happy life as Business
Analyst during day, and at night I change into a tentacled being called
Coder.
</p>


<strong>Why not focus on just being a BA?</strong>
<p>Hmm.. an interesting question, but a difficult one to answer. I feel
software engineering is an eco-system and its good to know other aspects
of it as well. Since, I do not have the liberty to learn everything
possible in this world, I took programming as my secondary 
interest outside my regular job.Programming is fun, those little pieces
of code that you write, giving you results back either in the form of
some text getting spit on to your console or a small game is fun to
watch. This interest has a lot to do with the kind of games I happened to
play during my school days like "Dangerous Dave", "SKY", "Prince",
"Super Mario" etc.Although, I am not an excellent programmer, I try to learn little
everyday.</p>

<strong>Technologies explored so far ?</strong>

<p>I have been fortunate enough to have access to computers from my school
days, so I got exposed to the following languages in order from 1994
onwards.</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>LOGO - This is the first language I learned, I could draw house
    & flowers using this language.</li>
    <li>BASIC - This was the second one, I could never get a hang of it,
    Coz I was more interested in games.</li>
    <li>C - This one I learned in the first Semester of Engg. I hated
    it.</li>
    <li>Assemby Language(8085/86) - I loved playing with this language &
    8085 Simulator kits</li>
    <li>C++ - This was an optional course for 5th Sem Engg. students,
    but re-appeared during Post Grad, I loved writing LinkedList in
    native form.</li>
    <li>Java - This one eliminated my hatred for programming & made me
    hooked to web programming for few years, I even wanted to become an
    Enterprise Architect during those days.</li>
    <li>C# - This was fun to work with, I think anyone with decent Java
    skills can learn this one in no time.</li>
    <li>VB.Net - All you need is knowledge of Visual Basic 6.0</li>
    <li>VBA - This was an interesting scripting language based on Visual
    Basic, I learned this during one of my assignments with World Bank.
    It was fun to work with, and I got hooked to it for more than a
    year.</li>
    <li>Python - This one I learned by myself, for fun. It's an
    interesting language.Although, I learned it as part of my hobby it
    helped me to see programming with new eyes.</li>
    <li>Ruby - A funny and easy language to code with, You will feel you
    are talking to computer rather than typing in obscure english verbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Haskell</strong> - This one is something that I have started experimenting
    with recently.I wanted to learn a functional programming language
    and take my mathematical & algorithmic programming skills to next
    level. I hope this one will help me do that.</li>
  </ul>

 <strong>IDE's explored todate?</strong>

<p>I have been through my fair share of IDE's.But, these days I stick to
 just few of them so that I can do whatever I want using  minimal set of
 tools.</p>

 <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Notepad - This one is what I used first when I wrote my first
      Java Program.</li>
      <li>EditPlus - Migrated to EditPlus later when I started working.</li>
      <li>Eclipse - EditPlus became a tool to edit static pages &
      Eclipse became editor of Choice for all Java Code.</li>
      <li><strong>IntelliJ</strong> - This is my favourite editor for Java ( I have
      bought a personal License after using the tool for some 3-4
      years.)</li>
      <li>TextMate - I came across this tool while experimenting with
      Ruby, but didn't like it much.</li>
      <li>SublimeText - Chanced upon it on web, used it for a while then
      discarded it due to frequent "Buy Me" messages.</li>
      <li><strong>PyCharm</strong> - An awesome editor for Python+Django projects. I have
        a license for this one as well.</li>
      <li>XCode - It's a very good editor, but can be cumbersome at
      times.</li>
      <li><strong>MacVim </strong>- My current favourite editor for everything other than
      Java code.</li>
    </ul>
