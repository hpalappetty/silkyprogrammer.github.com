<h1>HELLO WORLD</h1>
<p>
My name is <strong>Hari</strong>, and I am an IT professional, living in the IT City of India (Bangalore). During my free time, I like to scratch on
Python codebases.
</p>

<p>I have been fortunate enough to have access to computers from my school
days hence managed to skim through few languages, some of them are cited below.</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>LOGO - This is the first language I learned, I could draw house
    & flowers using this language.</li>
    <li>BASIC - This was the second one, I could never get a hang of it,
    Coz I was more interested in games.</li>
    <li>C - This one I learned in the first Semester of Engg. I hated
    it.</li>
    <li>Assemby Language(8085/86) - I loved playing with this language &
    8085 Simulator kits</li>
    <li>C++ - This was an optional course for 5th Sem Engg. students,
    but re-appeared during Post Grad, I loved writing LinkedList in
    native form.</li>
    <li>Java - This one eliminated my hatred for programming & made me
    hooked to web programming for few years, I even wanted to become an
    Enterprise Architect during those days.</li>
    <li>C# - This was fun to work with, I think anyone with decent Java
    skills can learn this one in no time.</li>
    <li>VB.Net - All you need is knowledge of Visual Basic 6.0</li>
    <li>VBA - This was an interesting scripting language based on Visual
    Basic, I learned this during one of my assignments with World Bank.
    It was fun to work with, and I got hooked to it for more than a
    year.</li>
    <li>Python - This one I learned by myself, for fun. It's an
    interesting language.Although, I learned it as part of my hobby it
    helped me to see programming with new eyes.</li>
    <li>Ruby - A funny and easy language to code with, You will feel you
    are talking to computer rather than typing in obscure english verbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Scala</strong> - I am learning this programming language now .</li>
  </ul>

 <strong>IDE's explored todate?</strong>

<p>I have been through my fair share of IDE's.But, these days I stick to
 just few of them so that I can do whatever I want using  minimal set of
 tools.</p>

 <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Notepad - This one is what I used first when I wrote my first
      Java Program.</li>
      <li>EditPlus - Migrated to EditPlus later when I started working.</li>
      <li>Eclipse - EditPlus became a tool to edit static pages &
      Eclipse became editor of Choice for all Java Code.</li>
      <li><strong>IntelliJ</strong> - This is my favourite editor for Java ( I have
      bought a personal License after using the tool for some 3-4
      years.)</li>
      <li>TextMate - I came across this tool while experimenting with
      Ruby, but didn't like it much.</li>
      <li>SublimeText - Chanced upon it on web, used it for a while then
      discarded it due to frequent "Buy Me" messages.</li>
      <li><strong>PyCharm</strong> - An awesome editor for Python+Django projects. I have
        a license for this one as well.</li>
      <li>XCode - It's a very good editor, but can be cumbersome at
      times.</li>
      <li><strong>MacVim </strong>- My current favourite editor for everything other than
      Java code.</li>
    </ul>
